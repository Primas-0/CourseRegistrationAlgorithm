I. Effort Grading

   Program does not compile or does not run, or runs but does not
   produce output even after minor tweaks. Grading based on effort.
   Deductions from scripted grading and deductions marked below are
   ignored. Late penalties still apply.

   Choose one only:

   ~~  60:  Removing one or two major bugs will fix this project.
   ~~  45:  Significant progress made, but major rewrite is necessary.
   ~~  30:  Not much progress made. 
   ~~  15:  Barely started coding. 
   ~~   0:  Morally equivalent to no submission.

II. Tests in mytest.cpp

   == -2: Test insertion for a normal case of min-heap (either skew or leftist or both). Heap property is satisfied
   == -2: Test insertion for a normal case of max-heap. Heap property is satisfied
   == -2: Test removal for a normal case of min-heap (either skew or leftist or both). Removals happen in the correct order
   == -1: Test removal for a normal case of max-heap. Removals happen in the correct order
   == -1: test leftist NPL values are correct after multiple insertions.
   == -1: Test leftist NPL values are correct after multiple removal.
   == -1: Test setPriorityFn() rebuilds the heap correctly
   == -1: Test merge of an empty queue (edge case) with a normal queue
   == -1: Test mergeWithQueue() merges the two heaps correctly
   == -1: Test copy contstructor (Deep copy)
   == -1: Test Assignment operator (Deep copy)
   == -1: Test getNextStudent() throws out_of_range exception
   == -1: Test mergeWithQueue() throws domain_error exception

IV. Coding Standards

 X == -0:  Good indentation, comments, and choice of variable names

   == -2:  Poor or inconsistent indentation

   == -2:  Program uses global variables or static data members in lieu of 
           parameters and return values

   == -2:  In-line comments are terse and not meaningful
   == -3:  In-line comments are non-existent

   == -1:  Poor choice of variable names
